components library that we will be using is:
shadcn/ui
https://ui.shadcn.com/ (built on top of Radix Ui)
{since we are using next.js -> https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next}

we can create new layouts only for a specific route root:
inside the (root) folder, we create layout.tsx, which would be similar to the last one (used for the app folder), so we export the same code. 

shared folder is created, that stores the header and footer which would be used in various pages of the site, hence shared.
